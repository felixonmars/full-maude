---- Dear Paco,
---- 
---- It seems the stack overflow problem I was having had to do with the name of 
---- the module being "BOOL-OPS". If I change the name of the module to something 
---- else, it works fine. Essentially, after loading the MFE, loading a file 
---- containing the module

(set include BOOL off .)

(fmod BOOL-OPS is
 protecting TRUTH-VALUE .
endfm)

---- would cause maude to stack-overflow. I just wanted you know about that. I 
---- am still experimenting with the tool, and will let you know if I have further 
---- issues. Thank you.
